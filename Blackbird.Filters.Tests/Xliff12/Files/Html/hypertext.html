        <h2>The alt Attribute</h2>
        <p>The alt attribute should reflect the image content, so users who cannot see the image get an understanding of what the image contains:</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph with an <a href="img_girl.jpg">Girl with a jacket</a> embedded inside the text, which demonstrates how links can appear inline with content.</p>
